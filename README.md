# Unity Stealth Game

*Work in Progress*

A simple stealth based game where the aim is to get to the safe area without being spotted by the guards on the level. Each guard has a spotlight, which visually represents their Vision cone. Players can use obstacles and walls placed around the level to sneak past and around guards. 

The guards spotlight color will change if they sense suspicious activity or they can see the player. This is an added visual aid to inform the player to rethink their approach and reposition if need be. 

The game will have 3 levels. Naturally, the difficulty will increase with each increment.

Note: The art style and models are extremely basic!
